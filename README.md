Sped through the project in about 3 hours, just wanted to do it before my holiday. Didn't spend time focused on the UI, but fulfilled all project requirements. Didn't do any of the extra credit challenges. Some of the code got a bit hacky towards the end, but overall mostly happy with the code and the result.
